# Thermostat_Code
1. Designed a home thermostat system using KiCAD, MPLAB X and built a prototype with ATmega328P.
2. Improved temperature measurement accuracy by 30% through calibration of sensors.
3. Implemented user input for desired temperature and compared it with sensor data to determine system status. LM35-LP was used as sensor.
4. Integrated LCD display to provide real-time measurement data and furnace status.
Only Lab_4 file is my own contribution rest of the files are packages/libraries that are used in Lab_4 code file and are obtained from other sources.
